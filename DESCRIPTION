Description: It returns a data frame with names and hex colors (or CIELab coordinates). Data can be mapped to colors for use in data visualization. 'Ucie' optimally maps data points into a polygon that represents the CIELAB colour space. Since euclidean distances approximate relative perceptual differences in CIELAB color space, the result is a color encoding that aims to capture much of the structure of the original data.
